ls      (lists everything in the directory)
ls -as (lists everything in the directory including "hidden" folders)
cd ..   ( move up 1 directory)

Always start work by cloning most recent version of the repository

PULLING IN FROM GITHUB
1. Fork
2. Open Git-Bash
3. Create Project Directory
4. mkdir .git/
5. git init
6. git clone "url"
7. git status (make sure everything worked)

EDITING
8. make any and all changes, add files, code, whatever you want in the project folder

PUSH BACK
9. git add "file.extension" "blablabla.py" "blablabla.png" (this makes git track the changes you make to these files and
include them in the git flow process. Adding all of the files sends them to "staging", where they all can be committed at once)
10. git commit (git's understanding of your project is now fully up to date)
11. git push origin master (this sends your project back to YOUR github repository. origin tells git to push to the original link you
copy/pasted, master tells git that your version changes are being applied to the "master" branch as opposed to any other version you may
have in your repository)

PULL REQUEST
12. On github.com, create a new pull request to the original repository. When accepted your changes are applied to the original repository
